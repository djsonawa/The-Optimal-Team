For most football fans, May - July represents a lull period due to the lack of club football. What
makes up for it, is the intense transfer speculation that surrounds all major player transfers today.
Their market valuations also lead to a few raised eyebrows. I am curious to see how good proxy
popularity could be for ability, and the predictive power it would have in a poster estimating a
player's market value and compared it with the current market value they possess. Thereby a
poster describing an ideal team of 11 players who performed best at their respective position
with an optimal market value they should hold, the major transfers the top clubs need to perform
to achieve the optimal team and various background checks about the players and the clubs.
